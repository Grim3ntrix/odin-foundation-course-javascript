        let surname = "Doe";

        console.log(name);
        console.log(surname);

        console.log("You can also re-assign variables:");

        let age = 11;
        console.log(age); // outputs 11 to the console

        age = 54;
        
        console.log(age); // what will be output now?

        console.log("We might have a constant pi which will never change. We can accomplish this using the const keyword.:");

        const pi = 3.14;
        pi = 10;

        console.log(pi); // What will be output?... Upon testing this will throw an error. So, Let's avoid reassigning constants because it should not be change.
