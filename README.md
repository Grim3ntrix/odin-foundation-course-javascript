# Intro to JS (JavaScript)

## Introduction

In the previous lessons, I have learned how to structure webpages using HTML and enhance their appearance with CSS. The next step in my journey is to make webpages interactive, which is where JavaScript comes into play.

In this section, I will focus on the **fundamentals of JavaScript** and explore how to use it to manage and manipulate various interactions between the webpage and its users.
