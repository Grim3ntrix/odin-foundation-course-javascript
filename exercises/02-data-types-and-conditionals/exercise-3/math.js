 * Lets do some math!
 * Some rules first:
 *   - Replace the strings to the right of the = with the math expression they describe.
 *   - Do not manually enter the answers to the equations. For example, `const a = 9` would be incorrect as 9 is the answer to the equation you're being asked to write out
